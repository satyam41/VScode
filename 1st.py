Python: python is computer language or machine language. It is easy to write code and vrestile language.

Tokens: keywords, identifiers, operators, puncutars, literals.

1. keywords: is, or, while, if , else, for, True, False, bool, and, etc.

2. identifiers: a = 10
        i. a-z or A-Z.
        ii. first letter should not be a number like 0-9.
        iii. in two words there is no space between them or no special character allowed like @, !, $ etc, accept underscor(_).
        iv. first word should be any alphabet then any number you can add.
        Examples : 
                Correct Variables : num1, user_input, num_file.
                Wrong Variables : 1num, user input, num!file.
a = 10
b = 20
c = a + b
print(c)

3.operators: i.arthmatic operators (+,-,*,/,//,**,%)
             ii.bitwise operators (&, ^, |)
             iii. shift operators (<<, >>)
             iv. identity operators (is, is not)
             v. relational operators (>, <, >=, <=, ==, !=)
             vi. logical operators (and, or)
             vii. assignment operators (=)
             viii. membership operators (in, not in)
             ix. arthmatic-assignment operators (/=, *=, -=, +=, %=, //=, **=)

4. puncutars: , '', :, "", ., etc.

5. literals: i.string literals
            ii.boolean literals
            iii.numeric literals
            iv. special literals None

data types : int for integer number, 
            float for floting or fractional number 
            eval for both integer or fractional number.
            bool for boolean value is 0 or 1 or True or False.
            

comments: in python "#" denotes comments. comments are single or multiline comments.

    # Single Line Comments.


    """ Multi 
    Line
    Comments"""
